# Virpil ACE | VPForce Mod

This repository contains the design files for my VPForce DIY Kit modification of the Virpil ACE pedals.

The build can be completed without making any permanent modifications to the pedals.  There are 3x M6 holes in the main pulley and pulley mounting plate that can be used to secure the center of the plate to the upper arm if you so desire, but that will require drilling 3x 6mm holes in the upper arm of the pedals.  These bolts are not required and , to date, I have not installed them on my build.
## CYA Note:
The Virpil ACE pedals 3D model that is part of these design files is of my own making.  It was not provided by, nor does it have any affiliation with Virpil.  The only truly accurate aspects of the model are the 130x135mm bolt pattern of the base and the M6 mounting hole locations where the gear mount attaches to the upper pedal arms.  The remainder of the parts are drawn by me using rough measurements and eye-balling.
## Primary Components:
- Virpil Ace Pedals
- VPForce 86BLF03 single motor kit
- Various Aluminum Extrusion sizes and lengths
- Assorted T-slot hardware (t-nuts, angle brackets, join plates)
- Various 3D printed parts
- A suitable timing belt
- A suitable drive pulley
